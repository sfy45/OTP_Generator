# Java OTP Generator

## Description

This project is a Java implementation of a random OTP (One-Time Password) generator. The program generates a secure OTP of a specified length using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The system ensures a strong password by incorporating various character types and using the `Random` class for generating random values.
